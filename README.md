Absolute-C++-5th-Edition-Solutions


This repository is solutions to the problems in Absolute C++ Fifth Edition by Walter Savitch.

The IDE used to program these solutions is: CodeBlocks 16.01. 

[Disclaimer: Though I've tried my best to solve the problems as asked by the questions. All the solutions in this repo might not work as asked by the questions. That might be because of my limited knowledge and that also has to do a lot with me being just an enthusiastic learner of Computer Programming rather than a professional in this field. Some results produced are affected by the compilers one has used to compile and run the program. One who take references from the code in this repo must be vigilant for such possible conditions/errors during program execution.]
